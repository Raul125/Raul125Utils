# Damage Hint
You receive a hint when you damage another player.

# Orders System
If you are an MTF Commander, you can use the command `.c Order`. It will display a hint or a broadcast, depending on your configuration, to all MTF players in your unit.

# Detonation Requirement
You need to activate a configurable number of generators to arm the warhead. This doesn't affect the R.A. button.

# Energy Overload
When a generator is activated, there is a chance that checkpoints will be blocked and the HCZ lights will turn off. All of this is configurable.

# Emergency Backup
If you are on the MTF side, you can call an Emergency Backup Team. You need to go to the intercom, have a radio in your hand, and start speaking. Then, an MTF squad will spawn. This has a cooldown and a maximum number of calls per round.

# Hard096Rp
If SCP-096 has a target, it will not calm down.

# TeamKill Broadcast
If you are teamkilled, you will receive a broadcast with the nickname of the killer. All of this is configurable.
